## Abstract

Why are rents in Lausanne so expensive? And who profits from it?

The real estate market is usually quite opaque to the public. Being ourselves
residents of Lausanne, we know how hard finding affordable housing can be.
Therefore we would like to know more about the market situation that causes
these difficulties. Our goal is to analyse cadastral and rental data in order to
find and visualise the ownership proportions of real estate in the city of
Lausanne and to understand how prices are composed.

More precisely, by leveraging public-domain data from the administration of both
the city of Lausanne and the _canton de Vaud_ we attempt to relate real estate
owners and high cost of rents. Furthermore, we try to understand the data from a
political point of view. Thereby we hope to improve the transparency of the real
estate situation and its effects â€“ _for the good of our society._
