Finding an apartment in Lausanne with a rent that fits a student budget is a
time-consuming and tedious task. If you have just arrived in Lausanne, you don't
know where to look. Is it cheaper on the hill or near the university? The
problem seems overwhelming because one does not know all the parameters that
come into play. And while running from one flat viewing to another you start to
wonder who owns all this real estate you would like to live in? Do real estate
agencies you mostly deal with own the houses they rent or do they simply manage
them?

As students at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/) we know how hard it can be to find
accommodation in Lausanne. Therefore we wanted to bring some light into the
opaque world of real estate. This analysis tries to get insights into the market
situation that causes these difficulties. We hope that this will help you
understand where to look for a flat and what parameters determine the different
prices across the city.

{% include question.html in_text=true

{% include question.html in_text=true
 text="Why are rents in Lausanne expensive?"
 image_url="assets/img/Lausanne_by_Night.jpg"
%}

## Combined
